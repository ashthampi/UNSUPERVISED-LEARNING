It visualizes the clusters based on petal length and petal width using K-Means and Hierarchical clustering algorithms

K-means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used to partition data into k clusters. 

Initializes k centroids randomly. then assigns each data point to the nearest centroid. after that Updates the centroids based on the assigned data points. then repeat the steps till needed.
K-Means is suitable for the Iris dataset because the Iris dataset has well-separated clusters. K-Means can identify distinct groups. The clusters are in spherical shape in the Iris dataset which is like K-means. K-Means doesn't require prior knowledge of the number of clusters, making it suitable for exploratory analysis of the Iris data.

Hierarchical Clustering is an unsupervised algorithm that creates a hierarchy of clusters. It can be either agglomerative (bottom-up) or divisive (top-down).

Agglomerative clustering takes each data point as a different cluster then it merges clusters  based on similarity. while Divisive clustering splits into smaller clusters from one big cluster.Â  

Hierarchical clustering is suitable for the Iris dataset because it doesn't require specifying the number of clusters beforehand. The Iris dataset some clusters are more closely related than others. Hierarchical clustering can see this relationship. It can handle different shapes and sizes of clusters, making it adaptable to the Iris dataset's characteristics.
